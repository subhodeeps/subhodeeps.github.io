> We might reasonably think about the end of the world as a continuous and never-ending process.

It takes nothing short of a genius to mix old science fiction clich√©s like time travel and the simulation hypothesis to produce a novel that is able to closely examine the human condition in light of exile, isolation and contagion.

But Emily St. John Mandel has managed to achieve this delicate feat in Sea of Tranquility.

The novel is short, engaging and one I'd surely reread a couple of times more.

I would definitely recommend it.
