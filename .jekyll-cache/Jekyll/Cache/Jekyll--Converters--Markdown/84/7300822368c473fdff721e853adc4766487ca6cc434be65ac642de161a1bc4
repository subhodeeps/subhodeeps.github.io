I"ò<p>The internet is a really cool place when it comes to learning literally anything and everything, provided you know where to find the right pdf file! Thatâ€™s why I have decided to keep a page where I can curate some of the lecture notes that Iâ€™ve enjoyed studying. Moreover, the sheer number of lecture videos available of YouTube is mind boggling. I have benefited from many such lectures and decided to include them here as well. I hope that some of you guys will find this page useful.</p>
