I";<p>We are feeble creatures made up of memories and experiences. What are we without them? Empty shells perhaps. Hollow men. How strong is our desire to relive certain sensations over and over again? Wouldn’t it be great if we could pull ourselves out of our fixed coordinates in this mechanistic spacetime and go on living in a sweet memory like insects stuck in some kind of pensive amber? Murakami, in this mind bending metaphysical thriller, tells us that perhaps such a spiritual dislocation is not a great idea. Memories are perhaps best left alone in our heads, in a library where we may visit every now and then, detached from the present. But that’s just a small part of the whole novel, one that stands out to me in my third rereading. There’s obviously a lot more going on, a lot more I don’t understand.</p>
