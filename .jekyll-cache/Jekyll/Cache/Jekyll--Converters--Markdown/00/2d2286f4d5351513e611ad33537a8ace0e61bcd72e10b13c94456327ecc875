<p>The internet is a really cool place when it comes to learning literally anything and everything, provided you know where to find the right pdf file! That’s why I have decided to keep a page where I can curate some of the lecture notes that I’ve enjoyed studying. Moreover, the sheer number of lecture videos available of YouTube is mind boggling. I have benefited from many such lectures and decided to include them here as well. I hope that some of you guys will find this page useful.</p>

<p>Of course, before reading any further,</p>

  <li>you should also check out <a href="https://www.phy.olemiss.edu/~luca/Topics/list.html">Luca Bombelli’s treasure trove</a> of notes and references on a plethora of topics in hep-th. Warning!
