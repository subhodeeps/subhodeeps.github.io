I"D<p>I love this book. Itâ€™s a priceless gem and one day I will put down in paper all that I want to say about this biography. But today is not that day. I will however take this space to direct your attention to a few articles that I had read. It is necessary since it is a boyish folly to put our heroes on a pedestal.</p>
