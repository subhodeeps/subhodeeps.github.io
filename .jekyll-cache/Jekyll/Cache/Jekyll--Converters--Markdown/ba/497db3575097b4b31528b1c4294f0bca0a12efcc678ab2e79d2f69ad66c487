  <p>â€œMy peak? Would I even have one? I hardly had had anything you could call a life. A few ripples. some rises and falls. But thatâ€™s it. Almost nothing. Nothing born of nothing. Iâ€™d loved and been loved, but I had nothing to show. It was a singularly plain, featureless landscape. I felt like I was in a video game. A surrogate Pacman, crunching blindly through a labyrinth of dotted lines. The only certainty was my death.â€</p>
