I am a Ph.D. student at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, working under the supervision of [Dr. Srijit Bhattacharjee](http://profile.iiita.ac.in/srijit/). My broad area of interest is *general relativity and black hole physics*. I am also working as a teaching assistant at the institute. 

Update:
