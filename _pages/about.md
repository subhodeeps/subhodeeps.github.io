Hey! I'm Subhodeep, a postdoctoral researcher at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Madras](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IIT_Madras). Formally, I am attached to the [Department of Physics](https://physics.iitm.ac.in/) and the [Centre for Strings, Gravitation and Cosmology](https://physics.iitm.ac.in/~csgc/index.html) at IIT Madras. My research interests include various aspects of gravitation and black hole physics, focusing on the internal structure of black holes, quasinormal modes, gravitational lensing, and black hole shadows. To put it simply, I use theoretical and computational tools to explore classical and quantum aspects of black holes in order to understand what they can tell us about the nature of reality. I'm also interested in the prospect of doing fundamental physics with gravitational waves. To learn more about my work, please check out my [publications](/publications/).

 I have recently defended my Ph.D. thesis at the [Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Information_Technology,_Allahabad) where I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Srijit Bhattacharjee](http://profile.iiita.ac.in/srijit/). I have also served as a research fellow at the [Centre for Theoretical Physics](https://www.ctp-jamia.res.in/), [Jamia Millia Islamia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jamia_Millia_Islamia) under [Prof. Anjan Ananda Sen](https://www.ctp-jamia.res.in/people/aasen.html). At, IIT Madras, I work principally with [Dr. Dawood Kothawala](https://physics.iitm.ac.in/~dawood/). 

Beyond black holes and general relativity, I'm keenly interested in exploring dynamical systems, and the application of machine learning techniques in physics and vice versa. I also take pleasure in teaching physics, mathematics, and programming. In the past, I have actively assisted my supervisor in teaching a diverse range of subjects such as numerical methods and computational physics, biostatistics, Python programming, and classical and quantum mechanics. 

I also enjoy meeting and collaborating with new people. So, please feel free to get in touch if you'd like to discuss and study some of the broad topics I've mentioned here!
