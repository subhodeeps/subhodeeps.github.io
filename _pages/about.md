I am a Ph.D. student at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad, working under the supervision of [Dr. Srijit Bhattacharjee](http://profile.iiita.ac.in/srijit/). My official designation is *Junior Research Fellow*, and my broad area of interest is *general relativity and black hole physics*. I am also working as a Teaching Assistant at the institute and I am actively involved in taking tutorial and practical classes, evaluating assignments and answer scripts, conducting viva voce, for the compulsory Engineering Physics course designed for B.Tech. students.
