I am Subhodeep, a Ph.D. student at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad. I'm working under the supervision of [Dr. Srijit Bhattacharjee](http://profile.iiita.ac.in/srijit/) and my broad area of interest is *gravitational and black hole physics*. 

Update:
-------
- **21 May 2020:** The preprint of our latest work, [*Mass Inflation in a Non-Extreme Rotating BTZ Black Hole*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09705), is now available on the arXiv.
