Hey! I'm Subhodeep, a Ph.D. student at the Indian Institute of Information Technology, Allahabad. I work under the supervision of [Dr. Srijit Bhattacharjee](http://profile.iiita.ac.in/srijit/). I'm also a research fellow at the Centre for Theoretical Physics, Jamia Millia Islamia, mentored by [Prof. Anjan Ananda Sen](https://www.ctp-jamia.res.in/people/aasen.html). My broad interest lies in gravitation and black hole physics, focusing on the internal structure of black holes, quasinormal modes, gravitational lensing, and black hole shadows. In simple terms, I use theoretical and computational tools to explore classical and quantum aspects of black holes and understand what they reveal about the nature of reality. I'm also interested in the prospect of doing fundamental physics with gravitational waves. To learn more about my work, please check out my publications.

My interests in physics and mathematics, however, are wide-ranging. Beyond my graduate research, I'm keenly interested in exploring dynamical systems and the application of machine learning techniques in the physical sciences. I also take pleasure in teaching physics, mathematics, and programming. I've actively assisted my supervisor in teaching a diverse range of subjects such as numerical methods and computational physics, biostatistics, Python programming, and classical and quantum mechanics.

I also enjoy meeting and collaborating with new people. So, please feel free to get in touch if you'd like to discuss and study some of the broad topics I've mentioned!
