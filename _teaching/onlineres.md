The internet is a really cool place when it comes to learning literally anything and everything, provided you know where to find the right pdf file! That's why I have decided to keep a page where I can curate some of the lecture notes that I've enjoyed studying. Moreover, the sheer number of lecture videos available of YouTube is mind boggling. I have benefited from many such lectures and decided to include them here as well. I hope that some of you guys will find this page useful.

Of course, before reading any further,

- you should drop by [David Tong's page](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/teaching.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} if you are looking for some amazing lecture notes on a varitey of topics in theoretical physics.
- you should also check out [Luca Bombelli's treasure trove](https://www.phy.olemiss.edu/~luca/Topics/list.html) of notes and references on a plethora of topics in hep-th. Warning! Don't get lost in the maze. [WAYBACK MACHINE LINK Oct 2021](https://web.archive.org/web/20211019193405/https://www.phy.olemiss.edu/~luca/Topics/list.html).
