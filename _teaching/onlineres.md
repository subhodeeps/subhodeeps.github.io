title: "Links to some good lecture notes and other useful online resources"
---

The internet is a really cool place when it comes to learning literally anything and everything, provided you know where to find the right pdf file! That's why I have decided to keep a page where I can curate some of the lecture notes that I've enjoyed studying. Moreover, the sheer number of lecture videos available of YouTube is mind boggling. I have benefited from many such lectures and decided to include them here as well. I hope that some of you guys will find this page useful. 

Of course, before reading any further, you should drop by [Prof. David Tong's page](http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/tong/teaching.html){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.
